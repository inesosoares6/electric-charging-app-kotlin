Electric Vehicle Charging Management System Mobile Application

## Context
This application was developed in the context of a college project where we needed to implement a system to manage electric vehicle charging. I was studying Electrical and Computer Engineering (automation and robotics), but interested in learning about web development. Therefore, I volunteered to develop the app for our project. This way, I could be responsible for a crucial part of the project and explore these new skills. Back then, I was far from knowing that web development would become my passion.

## Requirements
- Ability to search electric charging parks;
- Have multiple ways to read the charger ID (text, NFC, and QR code);
- Ability to charge the vehicle in multiple ways (regular, fast, and green);
- Check the prices for the different charging methods;
- Receive the total price when the operation has finished;
- Possibility to add several vehicles to the app;
- Store the charging history.

## Development
Technologies:
- Programming Language: Kotlin
- Database: Google Firebase (Authentication and Cloud Firestore)
